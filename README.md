# Business_Sales_insights

This project is based on computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build Tableau dashboard that can give him real time sales insights. The database which is used for this project contains all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information.
After analyzing the database I linked the database to tableau and performed some ETL and data cleaning operations.

# Some insights which were drawn from sales data

1) Sheet vs dashboard
2) Created label summarization of revenue, sales quantity
3) Created bar charts for various measures
4) Created year and month filter buttons for our dashboard
5) Revenue trend char

This is a interactive dashboard where you can see the sales of the product yearly,how much revenue has been generated, who were the top 5 customers of the company.
